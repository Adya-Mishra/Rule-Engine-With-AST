# Rule-Engine-With-AST
This project implements a Rule Engine that utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate complex rules based on user-defined conditions. The engine allows users to define rules using logical operators and conditions, store these rules in a MySQL database, and evaluate them against specific attributes.
